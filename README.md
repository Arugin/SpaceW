![alt tag](https://github.com/zameran/SpaceW/blob/develop/Logo.png?raw=true)

## Important NOTE From Maintainer ##
### 
Dear programmers and developers please note, that project have several years long rich history,
so a lot of provided components, such as code, shaders, architecture or parts of it are morally obsolete.
Knowledge and time doesn't stand still and so many virtue were invested.
If there enough people willing, then, perhaps, i will compose a comprehensive wiki.

## Disclaimer ##
* Strong language. So you don't give me crap about it.
* Strange code. This is like a nuclear test site.
* Black dirty magic. Like in 15th century, yay.
* That's was a project of life.
* That's not a game-ready solution.
* Some shader code was ported to Unity from Space Engine and Proland.
* Some stuff may not work or very experimental.
* Some small artifacts are normal due to engine version migrations and unexistance of testers.
* Some components using own inverted axis space.
* Some components could be without any license header.
* Currently there are a lot of trash.
* Low Unity's internals integration.
